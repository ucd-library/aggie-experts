# Project Overview

[Aggie Experts](https://experts.ucdavis.edu) is a joint pilot project
between the Office of the Provost and the UC Davis Library
[team](team.md). It serves as a central registry of UC Davis scholarship produced by academic senate and federation
faculty, researchers, experts and creators. Aggie Experts can be used as an
expertise discovery platform for finding collaborators, mentors and expert
opinions, as a showcase of the UC Davis excellence in research, teaching and
community service, and as a tool that reduces the administrative load on UC
Davis researchers and administrators.

## Infrastructure

The overarching principles of building out the Aggie Experts platform are to
avoid hosting data locally and to present all content as linked data. The data
sources are described in more detail below. Aggie Experts is inspired by the
[VIVO software tool](https://duraspace.org/vivo/about/) and uses their schema to
represent the data in RDF format. For more information, refer to our [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/ucd-library/aggie-experts).

## Data Sources for Aggie Experts

* We use the UC Davis identity management system as the source for the scholar’s
  name, title and unit affiliation. Researchers can change that information in
  the [campus directory listing](https://org.ucdavis.edu/odr).

* Publications metadata is based on scholars’ claims of publications in support
  of the UC Open Access Policy. Faculty can review with publications they have
  claimed, and what additional publications are pending review and approval in
  the California Digital Library instance of [Symplectic Elements publication
  management system](https://oapolicy.universityofcalifornia.edu/).

* The grants data are obtained from the university’s financial data warehouse.

## Data Fields

Activities and contributions to research, teaching and the community are
extensive. We work with faculty to choose from the following list of fields for
each new iteration of the registry. It is by no means exhaustive, and we are
open to additions: Name, Home department, Current position, Additional
affiliations, Photo, Research bio, Openness to collaborations, Websites,
Courses, Awards, Patents, Grants, Publications, Datasets, Software, Exhibits,
Performances, Conference papers, Gray literature, Collaborations, Mentorship,
Service. This list is intended long-term
visioning.

## Functionalities

A good registry needs to have a good search mechanism. We enable discovery of
expertise on campus through researchers’ scholarship reflected in each field we
add to the registry.

Aggie Experts is intended to function in accordance with the [FAIR data
principles](https://www.force11.org/fairprinciples). In many cases faculty are
required to provide the same information to the university, grant-funding
agencies, and conferences. Exports from Aggie Experts would allow the faculty to
reformat their content for those needs and reduce the time spent on
administrative work.
