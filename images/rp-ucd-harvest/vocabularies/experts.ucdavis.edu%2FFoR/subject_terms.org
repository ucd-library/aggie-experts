** Fields of Research

The ANZSRC fields of Research terms are embedded in the elements dimensions
data as well as the elements tools themselves.  There is no linked data
representation for the thesaurus, AFAIK, so we are creating that.

** Free Keywords

In addition to the FoR terms, we are taking all other terms, and adding them to
a standard free text concept term.  We are doing it this way, rather than using
a free text field, so that things that go together from say sharing a MeSH term,
can still be colocated together, with all publications and all users.  This can
make a transistion to a thesaurus less painful as well.

*** Adding Terms

We add terms pretty much the same way as in FoR, since the terms are the same.
The nice feature of the md5 sum, is we are gaurenteed they all match.
