* Adding an HDT file as a persistent graph

If you'd like to add an HDT file as a persistent read-only graph, then you need
to both load the data, and upload a configuration file for your container.

If you have a persistent disk image `fuseki-data`, then you can copy an HDT file
directly to that image.

#+begin_src bash
  docker cp example_graph.hdt fuseki-data:/fuseki/databases
#+end_src

An alternative would be to create a second volume that holds only the hdt files.
You might want to do this if you'd like to share that volume with other docker
containers.   This is okay, as these files are read-only..

#+begin_src bash
cat <<CONFIG >> example_config.ttl
@prefix :      <#> .
@prefix ja:    <http://jena.hpl.hp.com/2005/11/Assembler#> .
@prefix rdfs:  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix fuseki: <http://jena.apache.org/fuseki#> .
@prefix hdt: <http://www.rdfhdt.org/fuseki#> .

:example_service a fuseki:Service ;
    rdfs:label                      "Example Service" ;
    fuseki:name                     "example" ;
    fuseki:serviceQuery             "query", "sparql" ;
    fuseki:serviceReadGraphStore    "get" ;
    fuseki:dataset                   [ a ja:RDFDataset ;
                                       ja:defaultGraph :example_graph ] ;
    .

:example_graph a hdt:HDTGraph;
    rdfs:label "Example HDT Graph" ;
    hdt:fileName "/fuseki/databases/example_graph.hdt" ;

        # Optional: Keep the HDT and index in memory at all times.
        # Uses more memory but it is potentially faster because avoids IO.
        # hdt:keepInMemory "true" ;
    .
CONFIG;
# Then copy this to your image data
docker cp example_config.ttl fuseki-data:/fuseki/configurations

#+end_src

After running ~docker restart fuseki~ in this case, you will now have a
read-only additional dataset.
