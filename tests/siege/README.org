* Siege Testing

  This Makefile performs some siege testing on an Aggie Experts instance.  There
  are browse, experts, and search tests, although searches seem to be the only
  ones that tax the system. Run like:

#+begin_src bash
  make host=${host} urls=search d=results/stage32 siege
#+end_src

Where host is the aggie-experts host, d is the results directory, and ~urls~ are
the tests to run eg. ~urls="search experts browse" See the Makefile for other
parameters.
