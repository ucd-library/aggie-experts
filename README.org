** FCREPO Services

   fcrepo services are small functions that can be run on items in Aggie
   experts. This are used by internal services, but can also be used as
   debugging tools.  The following services are helpful:


*** svc:node
    This service shows how an item is represented in the elasticsearch
    documents.  A complete elastic search document is a set of nodes, this only
    shows the node related to a particular item.

*** svc:cite
    When applied to a work, this shows that citationstyles json for a work.
    This should be directly importable into a citation manager like zotero
