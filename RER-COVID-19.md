##Researcher expertise registry to combat COVID-19

To support UC Davis efforts to accelerate research around COVID-19, we rolled out an early version of researcher profiles. It included information about the research and interests of UC Davis campus members who indicated their interest to the Office of Research to find collaborators specifically for COVID-19 projects. The effort improved our understanding of developing collaborative applications and engagement with researchers. We are fully now focusing on developing and improving Aggie Experts.
