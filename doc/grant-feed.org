* Grant Feed workflow
UCD grants are imported into the CDL Elements system using the Symplectic Elements feed mechanism.
A CSV format file is uploaded to the "ucdavis" FTP account at ftp.use.symplectic.org. The file is
then processed by the Symplectic Elements system and the grants are added to the CDL Elements system.

Note that directories have been created for QA and Production.


** Legacy KFS Grant Feed Workflow
A one-time workflow to load all the grants from KFS into CDL Elements. A subset of the grants present in the KFS system have been designated as legacy.
They will not be carried over to the new Aggie Enterpise system. The legacy grants are loaded into CDL Elements using the Symplectic Elements feed mechanism.
A CSV format file is uploaded to the "ucdavis" FTP account at ftp.use.symplectic.org. The file is
then processed by the Symplectic Elements system and the grants are added to the CDL Elements system.
The grants are then harvested by the Aggie Experts via the CDL Elements API in the same fashion as publications.

** Grant Feed File Format
Two CSV file are need to load the legacy grants. The first file contains the grant data. The second file contains the links to associate grants with researchers.
The grant data file is named "grants.csv". The grant links file is named "links.csv". Both files are uploaded to the appropriate Symplectic FTP directory.

These column names correspond to the grant data "underlying fields" in the Symplectic Elements system.
Values are mapped to matching fields in the CDL Elements system in the Grants table.
Note that custom underlying fields can be added to the CDL Elements system to capture additional grant data.
See "Manage underlying fields: grant" in the Symplectic Elements documentation for more information.
